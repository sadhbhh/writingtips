<h1>WritingTips</h1>
    <h2>Don't Ramble</h2>
    <p>Rambling, using fluff words and adding unecessary details can make your work boring and less powerful. Try to use language that is concise and interesting.</p>
    
    <h2>Punctuation and Grammar</h2>
    <p>Punctuation is always important. Commas, full stops, semi-colons, etc make it easier for you to control the flow of your thoughts, and can make it much easier for other people to read and understand your work.</p>
    <h2>Edit Edit Edit!!</h2> 
    <p>You need to be ruthless when you edit. Shorten, delete, and rewrite anything that does not add to the meaning. It’s okay to write in a casual style, but don’t inject extra words without good reason.
To make this easier, break your writing into three steps: 1) Write the entire text. 2) Set your text aside for a few hours or days. 3) Return to your text fresh and edit.</p>
